# 5 Key skills
## Time Management
Time management is a key skill I need to learn to perfect if I wish to maintain a certain work flow to meet deadlines effectively and to the best of my knowledge and ability. Currently I am lacking in balancing time for leisure and work, if I were more work driven and were to stick to a rota or schedule then more work will be completed on time allowing me to edit any errors/bugs within my code and/or spelling mistakes. Within the professional games industry time management is an essential skill to work both effectively and also efficiently.

## Working effectively within a team
Working effectively within a team is another skill I definitely need to work upon, currently I frown upon working within large teams due to not being able to progress further in my own work if another team member isn't as motivated or focused as myself. This also works the other way around, my team members may be motivated and have work completed within a set deadline or sprint and I will have fallen behind due to time management or lack of motivation to the project. Within the professional games industry working effectively within a team is another essential skill as in most development studios work in large numbers and all need to have the same/similar line or thinking towards their work.

## Appropriate Research
Appropriate research is another skill I seem to lack in. Throughout this year I have read more research papers about things far from the subject matter than what could be used to make a powerful argument in an essay or within discussion. A way I can improve upon this is to include tighter search parameters when researching certain subjects. Within the professional games industry appropriate research is essential if I were to obtain any kind of market research role with the industry.

## Proof-reading
Proof-reading documents and work I have produced for assignments such as essays and other literature based assignments have thus far been poor. I will usually write documents directly into readme.md and therefore have no assistance with my spelling and grammar from external sources. I will usually forget to do so and therefore sacrifice marks within many of my assignments. Within the professional games industry proof-reading is a skill the employee should know to do for any form of documenting, this is usually a skill that the employee is assumed to use effectively.

## Motivation
Motivation towards work has been somewhat lacking. Thus far I have lacked in motivation towards both personal work and the group project with the BAs this year. If I continue to lose motivation towards my personal work and also group work then it will affect both myself in a negative fashion and also my teammates. Within the professional games industry if an employee were to lack in motivation then they will fall behind on work and therefore penalise the rest of their time and as a result could push deadlines back to make up for the lack of work. If all teammates were to motivate eachother then this shouldn't be an issue.

## Week One
Within the first week I was introduced to my team for the COMP230 game project. This week we began to start concepting ideas for our 3 prototypes for the project which is due a few months into 2018. I look forward to seeing what concepts we decide to scrap and/or keep.

## Week Two
This week myself and the BAs had started producing the first prototype of an FPS where the user will have to escape levels via stealth to slip past rogue AI. The prototype is somewhat lacking so far but the core mechanics are within the prototype. We have also made a start on our second prototype to make a basic RTS style game.

## Week Three
Myself and an artist made a start on a concept we thought would take off with the rest of the team and would be able to be ported to multiple platforms if we had polished the game off within enough time to do so. Development of this prototype was fairly swift and a couple of the core mechanics were within the prototype already and research was going into how to recreate another mechanic for random map generation.

## Week Four
This week our team had decided to scrap both my concept and also the first one containing the rogue AI. The majority of the team had chose to continue developing the RTS without the consent of myself and a few other teammates. 

## Week Five
The development of our concept is somewhat slow, due to the BAs working with C# and having to use C++ in the Unreal Engine 4 they are slowly developing some of the other main mechanics whilst I researched different ways to handle networking within our game.

## Week Six
I have been somewhat sluggish this week, I have been primarily focused on personal work rather than the project with the BAs. I have spent the majority of this week reading various research papers. 

## Week Seven
I have started working on the networking for our project with the BAs. So far what I have done is functioning correctly, hopefully I will have this finished by the end of this week/start of the next.

## Week Eight
This week the team have decided that they would much rather prefer to use Unity with C#, whilst this may make the BA programmers more comfortable using a game engine they've used for years and a language they have been learning for a couple of years, I have no knowledge of C# nor Unity. In hopes of furthering the team's ethic towards the project I have said i've no issue attempting to learn both the engine and also language. Given how far we are into production and how far away the deadline is for this project.

## Week Nine
This week I have been learning Unity by watching a few tutorials online about what does what within the engine to try and get comfortable with it. I will begin learning the language once i'm a bit more comfortable with the engine.

## Week Ten
During this week I have had a few deadlines that i've had to focus on, this hasn't pleased the rest of the team as the BA project hasn't been my main priority this week. 

## Week Eleven
This week I have been somewhat ill and therefore haven't attended the studio nor managed to get much work done. Hopefully I will be able to catch up next week.

## Week Twelve
Unfortunately I have been struggling with illness this week as well, this has halted both personal work and also group work. I am struggling learning both Unity and C#. I am also struggling with COMP220. I have missed a few lectures for this module within the past few weeks and have heavily fallen behind.
